Instead of following rigid rules, ML models are trained using data, gradually improving their performance through experience. This technology underpins many modern applications, from recommendation systems and fraud detection to self-driving cars and natural language processing. Machine learning techniques are broadly classified into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each addressing different types of problems. As the availability of data and computing power continues to grow, ML has become a driving force behind innovation across industries, shaping the way we interact with technology and the world around us.\"\"\"\n",
